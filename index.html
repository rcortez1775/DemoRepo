<body>
    <p> My name is <em>Robert Cortez</em>. I enjoy hiking, kayaking, swimming and playing games until my eyes dry out. I was the former
        sales/operations supervisor for Peloton Cycle. A New York based tech company that redefined the fitness equipment
        industry. After launching the company, I realized the power technology has and the huge amount of opportunity there
        is in the tech world. I decided to pursue coding with Sabio Coding Academy but did not enjoy the lack of structure.
        After researching, I found the
        <strong>UC Irvine Coding Bootcamp.</strong> Boy, am I excited to learn so much in these coming 3 months. Thanks for stopping
        by!
